Validation datasets are often smaller than training sets,
but they play a crucial role in measuring generalization.
A language model that performs well on validation text demonstrates
an ability to capture linguistic patterns beyond memorized examples.

Modern researchers rely on perplexity as a key metric for evaluating
the predictive power of generative models. Lower perplexity typically
indicates stronger fluency and a better understanding of context.

However, perplexity alone rarely tells the whole story.
Models may achieve strong scores while still failing
on reasoning tasks or producing contradictory statements.

As models grow, the challenge of evaluating them becomes more complex.
Researchers continue to explore new benchmarks, probing methods,
and diagnostic tools to understand model behavior.
